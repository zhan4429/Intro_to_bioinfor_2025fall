# Getting Started with Bioinformatics on Tufts HPC

## Welcome  

This workshop is designed to help you:  

- Begin working with bioinformatics tools and workflows—especially those that use the command line—on the Tufts HPC.  
- Get familiar with the bioinformatics resources and software available on the Tufts HPC.  

## Prerequisites  

You will need an [active Tufts HPC account](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing).  

If you’re new to HPC, please review our recent [Intro to HPC](https://tufts.zoom.us/rec/play/O1Zm1daWzJdvy2yciGGUwTZCSa1cUyu4wr89gk52-EYE99jr2iWnqgok3RC6QRMPGAvnH85pRvGgVfd8.SJyARyf_p10iqYqH?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1758646989000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ftufts.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FwmG-yY1txV5PNtlN4Wp6n8cM6fyXcPNx5uly4gi61V3tIH0RJ6Plqsxrz2fK4AzQ.7q1T6Xpaxe4kfKnd%3FstartTime%3D1758646989000) workshop.
