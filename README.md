## Welcome

This workshop is designed to help you get started with bioinformatics on the Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. We will cover:

- Working with bioinformatics tools and workflows on the command line.
- Discovering the bioinformatics resources and software available on the Tufts HPC.

## Prerequisites

You will need an [active Tufts HPC account](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing). If you are new to the HPC, we strongly recommend reviewing our recent [Intro to HPC workshop](https://tufts.zoom.us/rec/play/O1Zm1daWzJdvy2yciGGUwTZCSa1cUyu4wr89gk52-EYE99jr2iWnqgok3RC6QRMPGAvnH85pRvGgVfd8.SJyARyf_p10iqYqH).

    <strong>TIP:</strong> To test your account, try logging in to <a href="https://ondemand.pax.tufts.edu">Tufts OnDemand</a>. If you can log in successfully, youâ€™re all set. If not, please reach out to <strong>tts-research@tufts.edu</strong> for assistance.

## Connecting to the Cluster & Starting a Job

You can connect to the cluster using a terminal application (like Terminal on macOS or MobaXterm on Windows) or through the web-based Open OnDemand portal.

### Using the Command Line (SSH)

To connect, use the `ssh` command with your Tufts UTLN.

- **New Cluster:**
  ```bash
  ssh your_utln@login-prod.pax.tufts.edu
  ```
- **Old Cluster:**
  ```bash
  ssh your_utln@login.pax.tufts.edu
  ```

<strong>WARNING:</strong> <strong>Do not run jobs on login nodes.</strong> Login nodes are shared resources with limited CPU and memory. They should only be used for light tasks like submitting jobs, managing files, and editing scripts.
</div>

To start an interactive session on a compute node, use the `srun` command:

```bash
srun -N1 -n2 -t2:00:00 --pty bash
```

This command requests an interactive session with the following resources:

- `-N1`: 1 node
- `-n2`: 2 CPU cores
- `-t2:00:00`: A time limit of 2 hours

### Using Open OnDemand

You can also access the cluster through a web browser via Open OnDemand.

- **New Open OnDemand:** [https://ondemand-prod.pax.tufts.edu](https://ondemand-prod.pax.tufts.edu)
- **Old Open OnDemand:** [https://ondemand-pax.pax.tufts.edu](https://ondemand-pax.pax.tufts.edu)
